# vrEmu6522

6522/65C22 emulator written in standard C99 with no external dependencies.

Initially created for my [HBC-56 (6502 on a backplane) Emulator](https://github.com/visrealm/hbc-56)

## Early development

Unlike my vrEmu6502 and vrEmuTms9918 libraries, this library is in the very early stages of development. So far, I am only implementing features of the 6522 that I am actively using in my HBC-56 project. Additional features will be added as required.
